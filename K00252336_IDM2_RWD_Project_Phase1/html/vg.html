				<p>Vici Gaming officially transfers Eurus to Elephant
				The transfer dispute burnt a lot of bridges, however, after more than a month of controversy, Eurus has finally officialized his transfer to China’s newest Dota 2 super team now known as Elephant following a dissolution of the partnership between Four Angry Men and Elephant Entertainment Company.</p>

				<p>Vici Gaming announced the official transfer yesterday, putting the final stamp on an astoundingly messy saga for all parties.</p>

				<p>“Following sufficient communication between VG, Eurus, and Elephant, the club confirms that the transfer fee for Eurus was received. All three parties have come to a consensus: Former VG Dota 2 player Eurus officially transfers to Elephant Dota 2,” VG wrote, as translated by Dot Esports.</p>

				<p>The Singaporean offlaner’s most recent stint with Fnatic ended after two years, with him citing a desire to play “for another region.” The veteran played for a long list of some of China’s and Southeast Asia’s best teams, but this will be his first tenure on a North American team.</p>

				<p>The final two paragraphs were appreciative statements about Eurus’ three-year tenure with VG and wishing him well in the next stage of his career.</p>
